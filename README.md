# Video Streaming Platform
## Overview
This application is a high-performance video streaming platform that leverages modern Java technologies to provide adaptive bitrate streaming capabilities. The platform is designed to handle video uploads, transcoding, and delivery with a focus on scalability and performance.
## Key Features
### Adaptive Bitrate Streaming
The platform automatically adjusts video quality based on the viewer's network conditions, ensuring the best possible viewing experience across different devices and connection speeds. Using Java 21's Virtual Threads (Project Loom), the system can efficiently handle thousands of concurrent streaming sessions with minimal resource usage.
### Video Transcoding Pipeline
Videos uploaded to the platform go through an automated transcoding process that:
- Converts videos into multiple quality levels (1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, 240p)
- Segments videos into 6-second chunks for efficient streaming
- Optimizes for different devices and bandwidth conditions

### High-Performance Architecture
The application is built with performance in mind:
- Utilizes Kafka Streams for high-throughput, low-latency video processing
- Implements caching strategies to minimize storage access
- Leverages Java 21's virtual threads for concurrent request handling
- Uses reactive programming patterns for non-blocking operations

### Video Catalog Management
The platform provides comprehensive catalog management features:
- Video upload and metadata management
- Search functionality for finding videos by title or description
- User-specific video libraries
- Popularity tracking and trending videos
- Soft deletion with background cleanup

## Technical Stack
- **Java 21**: Utilizing the latest features including Virtual Threads
- **Spring Boot**: Core application framework
- **Jakarta EE**: Enterprise Java APIs
- **Spring Data JPA**: Database access and management
- **Kafka**: Stream processing for video segments
- **Reactive Programming**: Non-blocking I/O operations
- **Lombok**: Reducing boilerplate code

## How It Works
1. **Video Upload**: Users upload videos which are saved with metadata in the catalog
2. **Transcoding**: Videos are processed through a Kafka-based pipeline that segments and transcodes them into multiple quality levels
3. **Streaming**: When a user watches a video, the platform:
    - Generates a streaming manifest for the client
    - Determines the optimal starting quality based on network conditions
    - Serves video segments adaptively, adjusting quality as needed
    - Caches frequently accessed segments for improved performance

4. **Analytics**: The platform tracks viewing sessions and popularity metrics

## Use Cases
This platform is ideal for:
- Video-on-demand services
- User-generated content platforms
- Educational video libraries
- Enterprise video portals
- Live streaming services (with additional configuration)

The architecture's focus on scalability and performance makes it suitable for both small-scale deployments and large platforms with thousands of concurrent users.
